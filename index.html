              <h3>Project 1: Implementing an Intrusion Detection System: A Comprehensive Approach</h3>
              <p>An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a software application or device that monitors and analyzes network or system activities for malicious or unauthorized activities. This script calculates the SHA-256 hash of all files in the file system and compares them to the known hashes stored in the known_hashes dictionary. If a calculated hash does not match a known hash, the script outputs an "Intrusion detected in file" message. This IDS provides a simple and straightforward example of how host-based intrusion detection works.</p>
