          <h3>Project 1: Threat Identification and Control Effectiveness Analysis</h3>
          <p>This project involved assessing a widely-used email application to determine whether existing security controls effectively mitigated known vulnerabilities. The analysis focused on identifying potential threats, mapping them to control measures, and evaluating control performance. The outcome demonstrated gaps in protection and provided recommendations for strengthening the application’s security posture.</p>
